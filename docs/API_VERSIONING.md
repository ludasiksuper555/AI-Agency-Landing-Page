# API Versioning Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to API versioning, which ensures that we can evolve our API while maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients. A well-defined versioning strategy helps manage changes effectively and provides a smooth transition path for API consumers.

## Versioning Approach

We use a combination of URL path versioning and semantic versioning to manage our API lifecycle.

### URL Path Versioning

All API endpoints include a version identifier in the URL path:

```
https://api.example.com/v1/resources
https://api.example.com/v2/resources
```

This approach provides clear separation between different API versions and allows clients to explicitly choose which version they want to use.

### Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) principles for our API versions:

- **Major version (v1, v2, v3)**: Incremented for backward-incompatible changes
- **Minor version**: Incremented for backward-compatible feature additions
- **Patch version**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes

Minor and patch versions are not reflected in the URL but are documented in the API changelog and headers.

## Version Lifecycle

Each API version goes through the following lifecycle stages:

### 1. Development

- New API versions are developed in parallel with existing versions
- Development versions are available in a separate environment for early testing
- Documentation is prepared before the release

### 2. Preview/Beta

- New versions are released as "preview" or "beta"
- Available for early adopters to test and provide feedback
- May undergo changes based on feedback
- Clearly marked as non-production ready

### 3. General Availability (GA)

- Officially released and recommended for production use
- Fully documented and supported
- Guaranteed stability according to our compatibility policy

### 4. Deprecated

- Marked as deprecated when a newer version is available
- Still functional but no longer receiving feature updates
- Deprecation notice period of at least 6 months
- Deprecation is announced via multiple channels (documentation, headers, email)

### 5. Sunset/Retired

- No longer available for use
- Requests to sunset endpoints receive a 410 Gone response with information about migration

## Compatibility Policy

### Backward Compatibility Guarantees

Within the same major version, we guarantee:

1. Existing endpoints will not be removed
2. Required request parameters will not be added
3. Response fields will not be removed or changed in meaning
4. New optional request parameters may be added
5. New response fields may be added
6. Bug fixes and performance improvements may be implemented

### Breaking Changes

The following are considered breaking changes and will trigger a major version increment:

1. Removing or renaming an endpoint
2. Removing or renaming required request parameters
3. Removing or renaming response fields
4. Changing the type of a request parameter or response field
5. Changing the behavior of an endpoint in a way that affects existing clients
6. Adding new required request parameters without defaults

## Version Support Policy

- We support at least two major versions at any given time
- Each major version is supported for a minimum of 18 months after the next major version is released
- Security fixes are backported to all supported versions
- Performance improvements are typically only applied to the latest version

## Communication and Migration

### Announcing Changes

We communicate API changes through multiple channels:

1. **API Changelog**: Detailed documentation of all changes
2. **Email Notifications**: Sent to registered API users
3. **Response Headers**: Version and deprecation information
4. **Developer Portal**: Announcements and migration guides
5. **Blog Posts**: For significant changes and new versions

### Deprecation Headers

Deprecated endpoints include the following HTTP headers:

```
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2023 23:59:59 GMT
Link: <https://api.example.com/v2/resources>; rel="successor-version"
```

### Migration Guides

For each new major version, we provide:

1. Comprehensive migration guides
2. Code examples for common use cases
3. Comparison tables showing old vs. new endpoints
4. Tools to help identify usage of deprecated features

## Version Discovery

Clients can discover API version information through:

### Response Headers

All API responses include version headers:

```
API-Version: 1.2.3
API-Supported-Versions: 1, 2
API-Deprecated: false
```

### Version Endpoint

A dedicated endpoint provides version information:

```
GET /api/versions

Response:
{
  "current": "2.1.0",
  "supported": ["1.0.0", "2.0.0", "2.1.0"],
  "deprecated": ["1.0.0"],
  "latest": "2.1.0"
}
```

## Testing Across Versions

### Automated Testing

We maintain automated tests for all supported API versions:

1. Functional tests for each endpoint
2. Integration tests for common workflows
3. Compatibility tests to ensure changes don't break existing clients

### Version-Specific Test Environments

Developers can test against specific API versions:

```
https://api-v1.example.com/resources
https://api-v2.example.com/resources
```

## Implementation Details

### URL Structure

Our API URLs follow this structure:

```
https://api.example.com/v{major-version}/{resource}/{id}
```

Example:

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users/123
https://api.example.com/v2/users/123
```

### Code Organization

Internally, our API code is organized by version:

```
/src
  /api
    /v1
      /controllers
      /models
      /routes
    /v2
      /controllers
      /models
      /routes
  /shared
    /utils
    /middleware
```

### Feature Flags

We use feature flags to gradually roll out new functionality within the same version:

```
if (featureFlags.isEnabled('new-user-fields', request.context)) {
  // Include new fields in response
}
```

## Special Considerations

### API Clients and SDKs

Our official API clients and SDKs:

1. Are versioned to match the API version they support
2. Provide clear upgrade paths for new API versions
3. Include deprecation warnings when using deprecated features

### Private vs. Public APIs

- Public APIs follow strict versioning and compatibility rules
- Internal/private APIs may change more frequently
- APIs marked as "experimental" may change without version increments

## Governance

### Version Decision Process

Decisions to create new API versions involve:

1. API design review committee
2. Assessment of impact on existing clients
3. Evaluation of alternatives that maintain compatibility
4. Consultation with key API consumers

### Exceptions

In rare cases, we may need to make breaking changes without a version increment:

1. Critical security vulnerabilities
2. Legal compliance requirements
3. Fixing severe bugs that affect data integrity

These exceptions are thoroughly documented and communicated.

## Conclusion

Our API versioning strategy balances the need for evolution with stability for our users. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our API can grow and improve while providing a predictable experience for API consumers.
