# API Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for integrating with our API. Following these guidelines will help ensure that your integration is secure and that sensitive data is protected.

## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Tokens

Our API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Here are important security considerations:

1. **Token Storage**:

   - Never store JWT tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage as they are vulnerable to XSS attacks
   - Prefer HttpOnly cookies for token storage when possible
   - For SPAs, consider using in-memory storage with refresh token rotation

2. **Token Validation**:

   - Always validate tokens on the server-side
   - Check the token signature, expiration time, and issuer
   - Implement proper token revocation mechanisms

3. **Token Lifetime**:
   - Access tokens should have a short lifetime (15-60 minutes)
   - Use refresh tokens with longer lifetimes for obtaining new access tokens
   - Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security

### Authorization Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**:

   - Request only the permissions your application needs
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) appropriately

2. **Regular Permission Reviews**:
   - Periodically review the permissions your application uses
   - Remove unused permissions to minimize attack surface

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. **Data Minimization**:

   - Only request and store the data you need
   - Implement proper data retention policies

2. **Data in Transit**:

   - Always use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement certificate pinning in mobile applications
   - Use the latest TLS version (TLS 1.3 recommended)

3. **Data at Rest**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data before storing it
   - Use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms
   - Properly manage encryption keys

### Personal Data Considerations

1. **GDPR Compliance**:

   - Implement mechanisms for data export and deletion
   - Obtain proper consent for data processing
   - Document your data processing activities

2. **Data Breach Response**:
   - Have a plan for responding to potential data breaches
   - Implement logging and monitoring to detect breaches
   - Be prepared to notify affected users if required

## Input Validation and Output Encoding

1. **Input Validation**:

   - Validate all input parameters (type, format, length, range)
   - Use whitelist validation when possible
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **Output Encoding**:
   - Properly encode data before displaying it to users
   - Use context-appropriate encoding (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
   - Be cautious with user-generated content

## Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

1. **Injection Attacks**:

   - Use parameterized queries or ORM for database operations
   - Avoid dynamic SQL or NoSQL queries with user input
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:

   - Implement proper Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Use frameworks that automatically escape output
   - Validate and sanitize user input

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:

   - Use anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
   - Validate the Origin and Referer headers
   - Consider using SameSite cookies

4. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**:
   - Validate and sanitize URLs in API requests
   - Use allowlists for permitted domains and IP ranges
   - Implement network-level protections

## Security Testing

1. **Regular Security Assessments**:

   - Conduct regular security assessments of your integration
   - Use automated security scanning tools
   - Consider manual penetration testing for critical integrations

2. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Monitor security advisories for components you use
   - Have a process for addressing vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

1. **Monitoring and Alerting**:

   - Implement logging for security-relevant events
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Regularly review logs for security issues

2. **Incident Response Plan**:

   - Develop an incident response plan
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Practice your response to security incidents

3. **Communication**:
   - Know how to report security issues to our team
   - Have a communication plan for security incidents
   - Document lessons learned after incidents

## Compliance Requirements

1. **Industry Standards**:

   - Follow relevant industry standards (e.g., OWASP Top 10)
   - Consider compliance requirements for your industry
   - Implement appropriate controls based on risk

2. **Documentation**:
   - Document your security controls and practices
   - Maintain records of security assessments
   - Be prepared for security audits if required
